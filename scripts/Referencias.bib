abstract = {The continuous release of pharmaceuticals from WWTP effluents to freshwater is a matter of concern, due to their potential effects on non-target organisms. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs and their associated hazard have been scarcely studied in Latin American countries. This study aimed at monitoring for the first time the occurrence of 70 pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) in WWTPs across Costa Rica; the application of the hazard quotient (HQ) approach coupled to ecotoxicological determinations permitted to identify the hazard posed by specific pharmaceuticals and toxicity of the effluents, respectively. Thirty-three PhACs were found, with 1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and gemfibrozil being the most frequently detected (influents/effluents). HQ for specific pharmaceuticals revealed 24 compounds with high/medium hazard in influents, while the amount only decreased to 21 in effluents. The top HQ values were obtained for risperidone, lovastatin, diphenhydramine and fluoxetine (influent/effluent samples), plus caffeine (influent) and trimethoprim (effluent). Likewise, the estimation of overall hazard in WWTP samples (sum of individual HQ, ∑HQ) demonstrated that every influent and 96{\%} of the effluents presented high hazard towards aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological analysis (Daphnia magna, Lactuca sativa and Microtox test) revealed that 16.7{\%} of the effluents presented toxicity towards all benchmark organisms; the phytotoxicity was particularly frequent, as inhibition values ≥20{\%} in the germination index for L. sativa were obtained for all the effluents. The ∑HQ approach estimated the highest hazard in urban wastewater, while the ecotoxicological results showed the highest toxicity in hospital and landfill wastewater. Likewise, ecotoxicological results and ∑HQ values showed a rather poor correlation; instead, better correlations were obtained between ecotoxicological parameters and HQ values for some individual pharmaceuticals such as cephalexin and diphenhydramine. Findings from this study provide novel information on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and the performance of WWTPs in the tropical region of Central America.},

abstract = {Medical substances (pharmaceuticals) are a group of substances that until recently have been exposed to the environment with very little attention. The reason why they may be interesting as environmental micropollutants, is that medical substances are developed with the intention of performing a biological effect. Especially antibiotics used as growth promoters, as feed additives in fish farms are anticipated to end up in the environment. Very little is known about the exposure routes of the medical substances to the environment. Only few investigations have reported findings of medical substances in other field samples than sediment or treated waste water samples. Several substances seem to be persistent in the environment. This paper outlines the different anticipated exposure routes to the environment, summarises the legislation on the subject and gives an outline of present knowledge of occurrence, fate and effect on both the aquatic and terrestrial environments of medical substances. Present knowledge does not reveal if regular therapeutic use may be the source of a substance carried by sewage effluent into the aquatic system even though clofibrate, a lipid lowering agent, has been identified in ground and tap water samples from Berlin. Further research would be necessary to assess the environmental risk involved in exposing medical substances and metabolites to the environment.},

Each stage in the infection of wood cell walls was recorded on film and rates of hyphal growth were determined. Hyphal growth in the chamber was linear but about five times faster than growth within wood cell walls. The formation of soft rot cavities within wood cell walls is oscillatory and determined by successive phases of apical growth of fine hyphae. Chains of soft rot cavities within wood cell walls are formed by the activities of lignolytic enzymes released along the hyphal surface. The chemical composition of the cell wall of the wood species investigated affects the rate of cavity widening.},

abstract = {In the last years more and more often detections of antimicrobially active compounds ("antibiotics") in surface waters have been reported. As a possible input pathway in most cases municipal sewage has been discussed. But as an input from the realm of agriculture is conceivable as well, in this study it should be investigated if an input can occur via the pathway application of liquid manure on fields with the subsequent mechanisms surface run-off/interflow, leaching, and drift. For this purpose a series of surface waters, soils, and liquid manures from North Rhine-Westphalia (Northwestern Germany) were sampled and analyzed for up to 29 compounds by HPLC-MS/MS. In each of the surface waters antibiotics could be detected. The highest concentrations were found in samples from spring (300 ng/L of erythromycin). Some of the substances detected (e.g., tylosin), as well as characteristics in the landscape suggest an input from agriculture in some particular cases. In the investigation of different liquid manure samples by a fast immunoassay method sulfadimidine could be detected in the range of 1...2 mg/kg. Soil that had been fertilized with this liquid manure showed a content of sulfadimidine extractable by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) of 15 $\mu$g/kg dry weight even 7 months after the application. This indicates the high stability of some antibiotics in manure and soil.},

abstract = {A huge amount of hazardous organopollutants, often persistent and toxic, is pro‐ duced annually over the world and may contaminate soil, water, ground water, and air. Being from various sources such as wastewater, landfill leachates, and solid residues, xenobiotics include phenols, plastics, hydrocarbons, paints, dyes, pesticides and insecticides, paper and pulp mills, and pharmaceuticals. Among biological processes for degradation of xenobiotics, fungal ones, being eco-friendly and cost cheap, have been investigated extensively because most of basidiomycetes are more tolerant to high concentrations of pollutants. Fungal bioremediation is a promising technology using their metabolic potential to remove or reduce xenobiotics. Basidiomycetes are the unique microorganisms that show high capacities of degrading a wide range of toxic xenobiotics. They act via the extracellular ligninolytic enzymes, including laccase, manganese peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase. Their capacities to remove xenobiotic substances and produce polymeric products make them a useful tool for bioremedia‐ tion purposes. During fungal remediation, they utilize hazardous compounds, even the insoluble ones, as the nutrient source and convert them to simple fragmented forms. The aim of this chapter is to elucidate the ability of basidiomycetes to degrade xenobiotics. This is an overview to present the importance of extracellular enzymes for efficient bioremediation of a large variety of xenobiotics.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the occurrence of parasites in wastewater and their fate and behavior during the wastewater treatment. The removal and destruction of parasites by treatment processes is considered for "conventional" (mechanical) and "natural" wastewater treatment systems. Wastewaters can contain a wide variety of excreted parasites, depending on the source of wastewater and diseases present in the sewage contributing community. The principal groups of helminth parasites include nematodes, cestodes and trematodes, while that of protozoa includes coccidia, flagellates, amoebae and ciliates. Protozoan parasites are found in wastewater as cysts or oocysts, depending on the species. Parasite removal is assessed by comparing the microbiological quality of influent and effluent wastewaters. In relation to inactivation, an assessment of the viability rather than the infectivity of eggs, or (oo)cysts, is done. The principal mechanism for parasite removal during primary treatment is by sedimentation, and possibly by adsorption onto solids that are settling out of the suspension. Detention time can affect the parasite removal performance of the primary sedimentation.},

abstract = {The use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation is foreseen as a possible strategy to mitigate the pressure on water resources in dry regions. However, there is the risk of potential accumulation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the edaphic environment, their percolation and consequently contamination of aquifers. In the present study, we measured the levels of a wide range of commonly used pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in sewage from a local wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and in soils irrigated with treated wastewater. Analysis of target compounds showed total concentrations between 73 and 372 $\mu$g L−1 in WWTP influents, and from 3 to 41 $\mu$g L−1 in effluents. The total concentrations of PhACs detected in surface soil samples were in the range of 2 and 15 ng g−1, with predominance of analgesics and anti-inflammatories (maximum concentration = 10.05 ng g−1), followed by antibiotics and psychiatric drugs (maximum concentration = 5.45 ng g−1 and 3.78 ng g−1, respectively). Both effluent samples and irrigated soils shared similar compositional patterns, with compounds such as hydrochlorothiazide and diclofenac being predominant. Additionally, PhACs were also detected in soil samples at a depth of 150 cm, indicating that these chemical undergo leaching associated with heavy-rain episodes. Their occurrence in soils was affected by temperature too, as maximum concentrations were measured in colder months (up to 14 ng g−1), indicating higher persistence at lower temperatures. Finally, the ecotoxicological risk of PhACs in soil was evaluated by calculating their risk quotients (RQs). The risk was very low as RQ values ranged between {\textless}0.01 and 0.07. However, this initial assessment could be improved by future works on toxicity using specific terrestrial organisms.},

abstract = {Emerging organic contaminants have not received a lot of attention in developing countries, particularly Africa, although problems regarding water quantity and quality are often even more severe than in more developed regions. This study presents general water quality parameters as well as unique data on concentrations and loads of 24 pharmaceuticals including antibiotic, anti(retro)viral, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and psychiatric drugs in three wastewater treatment plants, three rivers and three groundwater wells in Nairobi and Kisumu. This allowed studying removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment, identifying important sources of pharmaceutical pollution and distinguishing dilution effects from natural attenuation in rivers. In general, antiretrovirals and antibiotics, being important in the treatment of common African diseases such as HIV and malaria, were in all matrices more prevalent as compared to the Western world. Wastewater stabilization ponds removed pharmaceuticals with an efficiency between 11 and 99{\%}. Despite this large range, a different removal is observed for a number of compounds, as compared to more conventional activated sludge systems. Total concentrations in river water (up to 320 $\mu$g L-1) were similar or exceeded concentrations in untreated wastewater, with domestic discharges from slums, wastewater treatment plant effluent and waste dumpsites identified as important sources. In shallow wells situated next to pit latrines and used for drinking water, the recalcitrant antiretroviral nevirapine was measured at concentrations as high as 1-2 $\mu$g L-1. Overall, distinct pharmaceutical contamination patterns as compared to the Western world can be concluded, which might be a trigger for further research in developing regions.},

The majority of the studies on PPCPs in wastewaters involve analysis only of representative compounds for each class, while few studies reported for the analysis of several compounds from multiple classes of PPCPs in samples. In this light, the aim of this work was to develop a multiresidue analytical protocol based on solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled to liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometer-(LC-MS/MS) for simultaneous determination of 138 substances including 37 different classes of PPCPs that can be used for monitoring in wastewater. Hence, an extensive monitoring survey of PPCPs in four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in three cities of North (Thessaloniki) and Central (Larisa, Volos) Greece region has been conducted. In addition, the occurrence of the target compounds in raw waters of effluents from two medium-size hospitals located in the Larisa Region was investigated. Analgesics-anti-inflammatories (paracetamol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, salicylic acid), diuretic (furosemide), antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), anti-hypertensives (valsartan, irbesartan, telmisartan), psychiatric drugs (carbamazepine, venlafaxine, citalopram), stimulant (caffeine) and beta blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol) were among the most frequently detected compounds. The removal rates varied between the different therapeutic groups, as well within each therapeutic group, important variations in removal were observed, going from not eliminated to 100{\%}. Mass loading distribution in the different WWTPs was also evaluated. Finally, the risk quotient approach (RQ) for single substances and the cumulative RQ for the classes of the target PPCPs was used in order to identify the potential ecotoxicological risk posed in the tree trophic levels of aquatic organisms.},

abstract = {The intensity and character of concerns about antibiotic resistance, over the past nearly seventy-five years, have depended on a series of linked factors: the evolution and distribution of resistant microbes themselves; our differential capacity and efforts to detect such microbes; evolving models of antibiotic resistance and the related projected impact of antibiotic resistance on medical, social, and economic futures; the linkages of antibiotic prescribing and usage to the prevailing practice and identities of the medical and veterinary professions, and to the practice of agribusiness; the projected capacity of biomedicine (and especially the pharmaceutical industry) to stay ahead of such developing resistance; the perceived global context in which such resistance has developed; and the coordination of efforts and the development of infrastructure and funding to draw attention to and confront such microbial resistance. This paper traces the evolving response to antibiotic resistance through what at this point appear to be five eras: that between 1945 and 1963, a relatively optimistic period during which time the pharmaceutical industry appeared to most as capable of keeping up with antibiotic resistance; that between 1963 and 1981, characterized by increasing concern (though limited reformist activity) in the wake of the discovery of the transmission of antibiotic resistance via extrachromosomal plasmids; that between 1981 and 1992, notable for the explicit framing of antibiotic resistance as a shared global problem by such reformers as Stuart Levy and the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics; that from 1992 through 2013, during which time antibiotic resistance became linked to larger concerns regarding emerging infections and received increasing collective attention and funding; and that from 2013 through to the present, with antibiotic resistance still more palpably and publicly embedded within larger concerns over global emerging infections, social justice, and development goals, attracting interest from a diverse cohort of actors.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic, also known as antineoplastic, drugs remain an important weapon in the fight against cancer. This study considers the water quality implications for the Thames catchment (United Kingdom) arising from the routine discharge of these drugs after use, down the drain and into the river. The review focuses on 13 different cytotoxic drugs from the alkylating agent, antimetabolite, and anthracycline antibiotic families. A geographic-information-system-based water quality model was used in the present study. The model was informed by literature values on consumption, excretion, and fate data to predict raw drinking water concentrations at the River Thames abstraction points at Farmoor, near Oxford, and Walton, in West London. To discover the highest plausible values, upper boundary values for consumption and excretion together with lower removal values for sewage treatment were used. The raw drinking water cytotoxic drug maximum concentrations at Walton (the higher of the two) representative of mean and low flow conditions were predicted to be 11 and 20 ng/L for the five combined alkylating agents, 2 and 4 ng/L for the three combined antimetabolites, and 0.05 and 0.10 ng/L the for two combined anthracycline antibiotics, respectively. If they were to escape into tap water, then the highest predicted concentrations would still be a factor of between 25 and 40 below the current recommended daily doses of concern. Although the risks may be negligible for healthy adults, more concern may be associated with special subgroup populations, such as pregnant women, their fetuses, and breast-feeding infants, due to their developmental vulnerability. {\textcopyright} 2009 SETAC.},

These aspects were enhanced by the optimisation of the growth medium used and time of addition of the pollutant to the fungal cultures. Different media containing 'high' (20 g/L), 'low' (2 g/L) and 'sufficient' (10 g/L) concentrations of carbon and nitrogen sources were investigated. The medium containing both glucose and peptone at 10 g/L resulted in the highest Growth Related Productivity (the product of specific yield and $\mu$) of laccase (1.46 Units of laccase activity)/gram biomass/day and was used in all further experiments. The use of the guaiacol as an inducer further increased laccase activity 780{\%} without inhibiting growth; similarly the phenolic effluent studied boosted activity almost 5 times. The timing of the addition of the phenolic effluent was found to have important consequences in its removal and at least 8 days of prior growth was required. Under these conditions, 0.125 g phenol/g biomass and 0.231 g o-cresol/g biomass were removed from solution per day. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria has been a rising problem for public health in recent decades. It is becoming increasingly recognized that not only antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) encountered in clinical pathogens are of relevance, but rather, all pathogenic, commensal as well as environmental bacteria-and also mobile genetic elements and bacteriophages-form a reservoir of ARGs (the resistome) from which pathogenic bacteria can acquire resistance via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT has caused antibiotic resistance to spread from commensal and environmental species to pathogenic ones, as has been shown for some clinically important ARGs. Of the three canonical mechanisms of HGT, conjugation is thought to have the greatest influence on the dissemination of ARGs. While transformation and transduction are deemed less important, recent discoveries suggest their role may be larger than previously thought. Understanding the extent of the resistome and how its mobilization to pathogenic bacteria takes place is essential for efforts to control the dissemination of these genes. Here, we will discuss the concept of the resistome, provide examples of HGT of clinically relevant ARGs and present an overview of the current knowledge of the contributions the various HGT mechanisms make to the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {The spread of veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) and biocides via manure onto agriculturally used areas represents a very important emission into the environment for these product groups. Within this literature study, publicly available transformation studies with liquid manure are summarized. Transformation studies were evaluated regarding the transformation fate of tested substances, the origin and characteristics of used manure, the experimental setup, and the measured parameters. As main topics within the 42 evaluated transformation studies, the high dependency of transformation on temperature, redox potential, dry matter content, and other parameters is reported. Test duration throughout the studies ranged from 2 to 374 days and study temperature ranged from 5 to 55 °C. Only seven publications gave information on the redox potential of the manure. Further, the characterization of the matrix in many cases was inadequate due to missing parameters such as dry matter content or pH. Only three publications studied transformation of biocides. To allow for a consistent assessment of studies within the registration process, a harmonized internationally accepted and validated test method is needed. Additionally, monitoring data of VMPs in manure were collected from literature and evaluated regarding the origin and characteristics of the manure, the minimum/maximum found concentrations, and the percentage of identified compounds. Within the 27 evaluated publications, 1568 manure samples were analyzed and 39 different active substances for VMPs and 11 metabolites and transformation products of VMPs could be found in manure. Most often, the samples were analyzed for sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. Not one study searched for biocides or worked with a non-target approach. For sulfadiazine and chlortetracycline, concentrations exceeding the predicted environmental concentrations were found.},

abstract = {White-rot fungi (WRF) and their lignin modifying enzymes (LME) can degrade a wide range of trace organic contaminants (TrOC), which are suspected to cause adverse health effects in humans and other biota. Recent studies have successfully applied either whole-cell WRF or their extracellular culture extract to remove TrOC from the aqueous phase. TrOC removal by a WRF system is dependent on a range of factors including molecular structure of the TrOC, fungal species and their specific LME, culture medium composition, and methods to enhance fungal degradation capacity; however, the specific relationships between these factors have not been systematically delineated. The aim of this review paper is to fill this important gap in the literature by critically analysing the ability of WRF and their LME specifically to remove TrOC. Mechanisms and factors governing the degradation of TrOC by WRF and their LME are reviewed and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Due to recalcitrance of some pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs), conventional wastewater treatment is not able to remove them effectively. Therefore, their occurrence in surface water and potential environmental impact has raised serious global concern. Biological transformation of these contaminants using white-rot fungi (WRF) and their oxidoreductase enzymes has been proposed as a low cost and environmentally friendly solution for water treatment. The removal performance of PhACs by a fungal culture is dependent on several factors, such as fungal species, the secreted enzymes, molecular structure of target compounds, culture medium composition, etc. In recent 20 years, numerous researchers tried to elucidate the removal mechanisms and the effects of important operational parameters such as temperature and pH on the enzymatic treatment of PhACs. This review summarizes and analyzes the studies performed on PhACs removal from spiked pure water and real wastewaters using oxidoreductase enzymes and the data related to degradation efficiencies of the most studied compounds. The review also offers an insight into enzymes immobilization, fungal reactors, mediators, degradation mechanisms and transformation products (TPs) of PhACs. In brief, higher hydrophobicity and having electron-donating groups, such as amine and hydroxyl in molecular structure leads to more effective degradation of PhACs by fungal cultures. For recalcitrant compounds, using redox mediators, such as syringaldehyde increases the degradation efficiency, however they may cause toxicity in the effluent and deactivate the enzyme. Immobilization of enzymes on supports can enhance the performance of enzyme in terms of reusability and stability. However, the immobilization strategy should be carefully selected to reduce the cost and enable regeneration. Still, further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in enzymatic degradation and the toxicity levels of TPs and also to optimize the whole treatment strategy to have economical and technical competitiveness. The performance of enzymatic treatment systems including whole cell fungi, crude and purified free enzyme, immobilized enzyme and hybrid treatments were reviewed and compared.},

abstract = {Much attention has recently been devoted to the life and behaviour of pharmaceuticals in the water cycle. In this study the behaviour of several pharmaceutical products in different therapeutic categories (analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid regulators, antibiotics, etc.) was monitored during treatment of wastewater in a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). The results were compared with removal in a conventional activated-sludge (CAS) process in a wastewater-treatment facility. The performance of an MBR was monitored for approximately two months to investigate the long-term operational stability of the system and possible effects of solids retention time on the efficiency of removal of target compounds. Pharmaceuticals were, in general, removed to a greater extent by the MBR integrated system than during the CAS process. For most of the compounds investigated the performance of MBR treatment was better (removal rates {\textgreater}80{\%}) and effluent concentrations of, e.g., diclofenac, ketoprofen, ranitidine, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, pravastatin, and ofloxacin were steadier than for the conventional system. Occasionally removal efficiency was very similar, and high, for both treatments (e.g. for ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, paroxetine, and hydrochlorothiazide). The antiepileptic drug carbamazepine was the most persistent pharmaceutical and it passed through both the MBR and CAS systems untransformed. Because there was no washout of biomass from the reactor, high-quality effluent in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium content (N-NH4), total suspended solids (TSS), and total organic carbon (TOC) was obtained. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

The application of two strategies for the re-inoculation of biomass was assessed during the fungal bioaugmentation of non-sterile sludge (42-d treatment) as an approach to improve the elimination of pharmaceuticals and other groups of emerging pollutants. Globally, the re-inoculation of biopiles with blended mycelium exerted a major effect on the removal of pharmaceuticals (86{\%}), brominated-flame-retardants (81{\%}) and UV filters (80{\%}) with respect to the re-inoculation with additional lignocellulosic substrate colonized by the fungus (69-67-22{\%}). The performance was better than that of the analogous non-re-inoculated systems that were assayed previously for the removal of pharmaceuticals. The results demonstrate the ability of T. versicolor to remove a wide spectrum of emerging micropollutants under non-sterile conditions, while re-inoculation appears to be a useful step to improve the fungal treatment of sludge. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The maximum MnP activity of polystyrene foam system was achieved 2-5 days sooner than with the other carrier systems studied. It was thus clear that the polystyrene foam approach shortened the culture cycle. Analysis of the carrier mechanisms employed in this study revealed that polystyrene foam had larger internal spaces and a greater surface area, and thus the potential to enhance the transfer efficiency of oxygen and nutrients to the fungus and accelerate its growth. The mycelia of the fungus were able to associate closely with the unique internal pore structure of the polystyrene foam, providing a more quiescent microenvironment and helping to maintain the stability of the cultivation system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Nowadays, hospital wastewaters are co-treated with urban wastewater; however, the dilution factor and the inefficiency of wastewater treatment plants in the removal of PhACs and EDCs make inappropriate the co-treatment of both effluents. In this paper, a new alternative to pre-treat hospital wastewater concerning the removal of PhACs and EDCs is presented. The treatment was carried out in a batch fluidized bed bioreactor under sterile and non-sterile conditions with Trametes versicolor pellets. Results on non-sterile experiments pointed out that 46 out of the 51 detected PhACs and EDCs were partially to completely removed. The total initial PhAC amount into the bioreactor was 8185. $\mu$g in sterile treatment and 8426. $\mu$g in non-sterile treatment, and the overall load elimination was 83.2{\%} and 53.3{\%} in their respective treatments. In addition, the Microtox test showed reduction of wastewater toxicity after the treatment.

abstract = {The fate of three endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), namely 4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP), triclosan (TCS) and bisphenol A (BPA), was studied in activated sludge process. The effect of sludge retention time (SRT) on their sorption and biodegradation was also investigated. Three continuous-flow activated sludge systems were used, operating at SRT of 3, 10 and 20 days, respectively. Batch experiments with biomass originated from the aforementioned systems showed that 4-n-NP and TCS are significantly sorbed on the suspended solids, while BPA to a lesser extent. The sorption affinity of target compounds did not seem to be affected by SRT, with the exception of 4-n-NP for which higher values of sorption coefficients were calculated at SRT of 3 days. The operation of continuous-flow systems in the presence of 10-40 $\mu$g L-1 of EDCs indicated that more than 90{\%}, 94{\%} and 97{\%} of BPA, TCS and 4-n-NP, respectively, can be removed during the activated sludge process in systems operating at SRT of 3-20 days. Determination of EDCs in the dissolved and particulate phase and calculation of their mass flux revealed that biodegradation was the principal removal mechanism of EDCs. For SRT values used in this study, this parameter does not seem to affect significantly percentage biodegradation of BPA. On the other hand, biodegradation of 4-n-NP and TCS was enhanced at SRT of 20 days. Calculation of biotransformation rates showed that the highest values for all EDCs were calculated at SRT of 3 days. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The sorption and biodegradation of three sulfonamide antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), and sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), in an activated sludge system were investigated. Experiments were carried out by contacting 100$\mu$g/L of each sulfonamide compound individually with 2.56g/L of MLSS at 25±0.5°C, pH 7.0, and dissolved oxygen of 3.0±0.1mg/L in a batch reactor over different periods of 2d and 14d. All sulfonamides were removed completely over 11-13d. Sorptive equilibrium was established well within the first few hours, followed by a lag period of 1-3 days before biodegradation was to deplete the antibiotic compounds linearly in the ensuing 10 days. Apparent zeroth-order rate constants were obtained by regression analysis of measured aqueous concentration vs. time profiles to a kinetic model accounting for sorption and biodegradation; they were 8.1, 7.9, and 7.7$\mu$g/L/d for SDM, SMX, and SMM, respectively, at activated sludge concentration of 2.56g/L. The measured kinetics implied that with typical hydraulic retention time (e.g. 6h) provided by WWTP the removal of sulfonamide compounds from the wastewater during the activated sludge process would approximate 2$\mu$g/L. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Diclofenac (DCF) is a common anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that is often detected in waste wasters, effluents and surface waters. Recently, DCF was included in the watch list of substances in EU that requires its environmental monitoring in the member states. DCF is also known to harmfully affect several environmental species already at concentrations of ≤. 1. $\mu$g/l. This review focuses on the occurrence and fate of DCF in conventional wastewater treatment processes. Research done in this area was gathered and analyzed in order to find out the possibilities to enhance DCF elimination during biological wastewater treatment. More precisely, human metabolism, concentrations in wastewater influents and effluents, elimination rates in the treatment train, roles of sorption and biotransformation mechanisms during the treatment as well as formation of transformation products are reported. Additionally, the effect of process configuration, i.e. conventional activated sludge (CAS), biological nutrient removal (BNR), membrane bioreactor (MBR) and attached-growth bioreactor, and process parameters, i.e. solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are presented. Generally, DCF is poorly biodegradable which often translates into low elimination rates during biological wastewater treatment. Only a minor portion is sorbed to sludge. MBR and attached-growth bioreactors may result in higher elimination of DCF over CAS or BNR. Long SRTs ({\textgreater}. 150. d) favor the DCF elimination due to sludge adaptation. Longer HRTs ({\textgreater}. 2-3. d) could significantly increase the elimination of DCF during biological wastewater treatment. Bioaugmentation could be used to enhance DCF elimination, however, this requires more research on microbial communities that are able to degrade DCF. Also, further research is needed to gain more information about the deconjugation processes and biotic and abiotic transformation and the nature of transformation products. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Though membrane bioreactor (MBR) has made an enormous progress and has become a promising approach in wastewater treatment, there are still several limitations on conventional MBR and thus there emerged integrated MBR for wastewater treatment technology. This paper aims to provide a consolidated review on the current state of research for the integrated MBR system with other technologies for wastewater treatment and help to sustain the treatment process itself. The areas for potential applications of various types of MBR are discussed in this review article. It is expected to provide future prospects to implement integrated MBR as a promising wastewater treatment technology. The valorization of wastewater in integrated MBR would reduce pollution and more importantly open a new source of energy and nutrients. Moreover the integrated MBR makes energy and nutrient recovery to be environmentally and economically feasible.},

This review outlined the recent development in the synthesis of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents as well as highlighted their applications in the removal of heavy metals, dyes, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and mixed pollutants from water. The cross-linked and immobilized cyclodextrin-based adsorbents exhibited excellent adsorption performances. The removal of dyes and heavy metals were effectively controlled by ion exchanging, mainly depending upon the pH; while the adsorptions of EDCs always occurred in cyclodextrin cavities and pH-independent. An easier separation process between aqueous and adsorbents could be achieved compared to native cyclodextrin, which promoted the application of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents in practical industry. This review could provide an inspiration for the advanced study in the development of cyclodextrin-based adsorbents for high efficiency wastewater treatment.},

abstract = {Oxygen activation during oxidation of the lignin-derived hydroquinones 2-methoxy-1,4-benzohydroquinone (MBQH2) and 2,6- dimethoxy-1,4-benzohydroquinone (DBQH2) by laccase from Pleurotus eryngii was examined. Laccase oxidized DBQH2 more efficiently than it oxidized MBQH2; both the affinity and maximal velocity of oxidation were higher for DBQH2 than for MBQH2. Autoxidation of the semiquinones produced by laccase led to the activation of oxygen, producing superoxide anion radicals (Q.- + O2 mutually implies Q + O2.-). As this reaction is reversible, its existence was first noted in studies of the effect of systems consuming and producing O2.- on quinone formation rates. Then, the production of H2O2 in laccase reactions, as a consequence of O2.- dismutation, confirmed that semiquinones autoxidized. The highest H2O2 levels were obtained with DBQH2, indicating that DBQ.- autoxidized to a greater extent than did MBQ.-. Besides undergoing autoxidation, semiquinones were found to be transformed into quinones via dismutation and laccase oxidation. Two ways of favoring semiquinone autoxidation over dismutation and laccase oxidation were increasing the rate of O2.- consumption with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and recycling of quinones with diaphorase (a reductase catalyzing the divalent reduction of quinones). These two strategies made the laccase reaction conditions more natural, since O2.-, besides undergoing dismutation, reacts with Mn2+, Fe3+, and aromatic radicals. In addition, quinones are continuously reduced by the mycelium of white-rot fungi. The presence of SOD in laccase reactions increased the extent of autoxidation of 100 $\mu$M concentrations of MBQ.- and DBQ.- from 4.5 to 30.6{\%} and from 19.6 to 40.0{\%}, respectively. With diaphorase, the extent of MBQ.- autoxidation rose to 13.8{\%} and that of DBQ.- increased to 39.9{\%}.},

In particular, we examined the influence of 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (anisaldehyde), Mn2+, and oxalate on Pleurotus eryngii .OH generation. Our standard quinone redox cycling conditions combined mycelium from laccase-producing cultures with 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DBQ) and Fe3+-EDTA. The main reactions involved in .OH production under these conditions have been shown to be (i) DBQ reduction to hydroquinone (DBQH2) by cell-bound dehydrogenase activities; (ii) DBQH2 oxidation to semiquinone (DBQ.-) by laccase; (iii) DBQ.- autoxidation, catalyzed by Fe3+-EDTA, producing superoxide (O 2.-) and Fe2+-EDTA; (iv) O2.- dismutation, generating H2O2; and (v) the Fenton reaction. Compared to standard quinone redox cycling conditions, .OH production was increased 1.2- and 3.0-fold by the presence of anisaldehyde and Mn2+, respectively, and 3.1-fold by substituting Fe3+-EDTA with Fe3+-oxalate. A 6.3-fold increase was obtained by combining Mn2+ and Fe3+-oxalate. These increases were due to enhanced production of H2O2 via anisaldehyde redox cycling and O2.- reduction by Mn 2+. They were also caused by the acceleration of the DBQ redox cycle as a consequence of DBQH2 oxidation by both Fe3+-oxalate and the Mn3+ generated during O2.- reduction. Finally, induction of .OH production through quinone redox cycling enabled P. eryngii to oxidize phenol and the dye reactive black 5, obtaining a high correlation between the rates of .OH production and pollutant oxidation.

Procedures ranging from sampling in the field and instrumental analytical methods to the data processing for mass balance estimation of the target basin are also described. All anticancer drugs concerned with this article were detected in sewage and river waters, where the presence of bicalutamide (BLT) was identified at considerably high concentrations (maximum 254 ng/L in the main stream, 151 ng/L in tributaries, and 1032 ng/L in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents). In addition, sorption distribution coefficient (logKd) values showed a tendency to become higher in the silty sediments at Suita Bridge than in the sandy sediments at Hirakata Bridge; these trends were supported by the results of the laboratory-scale sorption experiment. STPs were concluded to be the main sources of the anticancer drug load in the river, and a mass flux evaluation revealed that the effect of attenuation in the river environment was small. The effectiveness of ozonation in the sewage treatment process for removal of these anticancer drugs was further confirmed. The present article should be of value for facilitating the environmental risk assessment of a wide range of drugs in a broader geographical area.},

The purpose of this report was to conduct a systematic review of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment. The methodology adopted was carried out in compliance with the PRISMA guidelines. From the 75 studies that met the specific requirements for inclusion, data extracted showed that the most common anticancer drugs studied are cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen, ifosfamide and methotrexate with concentrations measured ranging between 0.01 and 86,200 ng/L. There was significant variation in the methodologies employed due to lack of available guidelines to address sampling techniques, seasonal variability and analytical strategy. The most routinely used technique for quantitative determination was found to be solid-phase extraction followed by LC-MS analysis. The lowest reported recovery percentage was 11{\%}, and the highest limit of detection was 1700 ng/L. This indicated the inadequacy of some methods to analyse anticancer drugs and the failure to obtain reliable results. The significant heterogeneity within methodologies made it difficult to compare results and draw conclusions, nevertheless, this study aids in the extrapolation of proposed recommendations to guide future studies and reviews.},

abstract = {Objectives: Exposure to antineoplastic drugs should be avoided due to the risk of getting adverse health effects. Antineoplastic drugs such as cyclophosphamide (CP) and ifosfamide (IF) are commonly used in medical attendance. In this study the variability of surface contamination of CP and IF was investigated by repeated wipe sampling over time in four workplaces in a university hospital. The surface contamination levels were also evaluated and health care workers were biologically monitored. Methods: A hospital pharmacy, two oncology wards and one oncology outpatient department were selected. Between 10 and 13 different surface areas such as work areas, floors and handles were selected in each workplace and wiped between 7 and 8 times during 9 months. Pre- and post-shift urine samples were collected from the workers in the investigated workplaces. Analysis was performed by liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Measurable amounts of CP and IF were detected on the majority of the sampled surfaces. The highest concentrations were found on the floors in the patient lavatories and utility rooms (up to 95 ng cm-2). In general, the surface contamination of CP and IF on floors did not vary much over time. Work areas and handles had larger variability. Neither CP nor IF were detected in any of the collected urine samples. Conclusions: The variability in surface contamination of CP and IF was rather low especially on floors. Higher concentrations of CP and IF were found on the floors compared with the work areas. The highest surface loads were found on floors (in patient lavatories and utility rooms) that were related to patient activities such as handling of patients' urine. Although high contaminations were found, the biological monitoring showed no uptake. Wipe sampling is a good method to improve the work practices. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

At environmental relevant concentrations tested in this study, biodegradation and adsorption were the major removal routes for the target antibiotics, where volatilization and hydrolysis were neglectable. Among the 11 target antibiotics, cefalexin and the two sulfonamides were predominantly removed by biodegradation in both freshwater and saline sewage systems. Ampicillin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, tetracycline, roxithromycin, and trimethoprim were mainly removed by adsorption. Divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) in saline sewage significantly decreased the adsorption of the three fluoroquinolones onto activated sludge. These three fluoroquinolones also exhibited certain biodegradability in the saline activated sludge reactor. Erythromycin-H2O was persistent in both saline and freshwater systems under the experimental conditions and could not be removed at all.

The technologies evaluated were mechanical (i.e., activated sludge with secondary treatment), lagoon (facultative, anaerobic, and aerobic), and land treatment systems (e.g., slow rate irrigation, rapid infiltration, and overland flow). The economic indicators selected were capital, operation and management, and user costs because they determine the economic affordability of a particular technology to a community. Environmental indicators include energy use, because it indirectly measures resource utilization, and performance of the technology in removing conventional wastewater constituents such as biochemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, phosphorus, and pathogens. These indicators also determine the reuse potential of the treated wastewater. Societal indicators capture cultural acceptance of the technology through public participation and also measure whether there is improvement in the community from the specific technology through increased job opportunities, better education, or an improved local environment. While selection of a set of indicators is dependent on the geographic and demographic context of a particular community, the overall results of this study show that there are varying degrees of sustainability with each treatment technology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {To protect the ecosystem and drinking water resources in Switzerland and in the countries of the downstream catchments, a new Swiss water protection act entered into force in 2016 aiming to reduce the discharge of micropollutants from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). As a consequence, selected WWTPs must be upgraded by an advanced treatment for micropollutant abatement with suitable and economic options such as (powdered) activated carbon treatment or ozonation. WWTP Neugut (105′000 people equivalent) was the first WWTP in Switzerland to implement a long-term full-scale ozonation. Differing specific ozone doses in the range of 0.35–0.97 g O3/g DOC were applied to determine the adequate ozone dose to fulfill the requirements of the Swiss water protection act. Based on this assessment, a specific ozone dose of 0.55 g O3/g DOC is recommended at this plant to ensure an average abatement of the twelve selected indicator substances by ≥80{\%} over the whole treatment. A monitoring of 550 substances confirmed that this dose was very efficient to abate a broad range of micropollutants by {\textgreater}79{\%} on average. After ozonation, an additional biological post-treatment is required to eliminate possible negative ecotoxicological effects generated during ozonation caused by biodegradable ozonation transformation products (OTPs) and oxidation by-products (OBPs). Three biological treatments (sand filtration, moving bed, fixed bed) and granular activated carbon (GAC, fresh and pre-loaded) filtration were evaluated as post-treatments after ozonation. In parallel, a fresh GAC filter directly connected to the effluent of the secondary clarifier was assessed. Among the three purely biological post-treatments, the sand filtration performed best in terms of removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and total suspended solids (TSS). The fresh activated carbon filtration ensured a significant additional micropollutants abatement after ozonation due to sorption. The relative abatement of the indicator substances ranged between 20 and 89{\%} after 27′000 bed volumes (BV) and was still substantial at 50′000 BV. In an identical GAC filter running in parallel and being fed with the effluent of the secondary clarifier, the elimination was less efficient. Seven primary OTPs (chlorothiazide and six N-oxides) formed during ozonation could be quantified thanks to available reference standards. Their concentration decreased with increasing specific ozone doses with the concomitant formation of other OTPs. The seven OTPs were found to be stable compounds and were not abated in the biological post-treatments. They were sorbed in the fresh GAC filter, but less efficiently than the corresponding parent compounds. Two OBPs, bromate (BrO3−) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), were formed during ozonation but did not exceeded 5 $\mu$g/L for bromate and 30 ng/L for NDMA at the recommended specific ozone dose of 0.55 g O3/g DOC. NDMA was well abated in all post-treatments (minimum 41{\%} during fixed bed filtration, maximum 83{\%} during fresh GAC filtration), while bromate was very stable as expected.},

abstract = {Microbial Ecology of Activated Sludge , written for both microbiologists and engineers, critically reviews our current understanding of the microbiology of activated sludge, the most commonly used process for treating both domestic and industrial wastes. The contributors are all internationally recognized as leading research workers in activated sludge microbiology, and all have made valuable contributions to our present understanding of the process. The book pays particular attention to how the application of molecular methods has changed our perceptions of the identity of the filamentous bacteria causing the operational disorders of bulking and foaming, and the bacteria responsible for nitrification and denitrification and phosphorus accumulation in nutrient removal processes. Special attention is given to how it is now becoming possible to relate the composition of the community of microbes present in activated sludge, and the in situ function of individual populations there, and how such information might be used to manage and control these systems better. Detailed descriptions of some of these molecular methods are provided to allow newcomers to this field of study an opportunity to apply them in their research. Comprehensive descriptions of organisms of interest and importance are also given, together with high quality photos of activated sludge microbes. Activated sludge processes have been used globally for nearly 100 years, and yet we still know very little of how they work. In the past 15 years the advent of molecular culture independent methods of study have provided tools enabling microbiologists to understand which organisms are present in activated sludge, and critically, what they might be doing there. Microbial Ecology of Activated Sludge will be the first book available to deal comprehensively with the very exciting new information from applying these methods, and their impact on how we now view microbiologically mediated processes taking place there. As such it will be essential reading for microbial ecologists, environmental biotechnologists and engineers involved in designing and managing these plants. It will also be suitable for postgraduate students working in this field. ISBN: 9781843390329 (Print) ISBN: 9781780401645 (eBook)},

abstract = {Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, with 9.6 million cancer-related deaths in 2018. Cancer incidence has increased over time, and so has the prescription rate of chemotherapeutic drugs. These pharmaceuticals, known as antineoplastic agents, enter the aquatic environment via human excretion and wastewater. The objectives of the present critical review were to investigate the risk of antineoplastics to aquatic species and to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding their levels in the environment, because many antineoplastics are not adequately removed during wastewater treatment. We conducted 2 separate literature reviews to synthesize data on the global environmental prevalence and toxicity of antineoplastics. The antineoplastics most frequently detected in the environment included cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; all were detectable in multiple water sources, including effluent and surface waters. These antineoplastics span 3 different mechanistic classes, with cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide classified as alkylating agents, tamoxifen as a hormonal agent, and methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil as antimetabolites. Studies that characterize the risk of antineoplastics released into aquatic environments are scarce. We summarize the biological impacts of the most environmentally prevalent antineoplastics on aquatic organisms and propose an adverse outcome pathway for cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, 2 widely prescribed drugs with a similar immunotoxic mode of action. Acute and chronic ecotoxicity studies using aquatic models are needed for risk characterization of antineoplastics. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:967–985. {\textcopyright} 2020 SETAC.},

abstract = {Most antibiotics are only partially metabolised by patients before being discharged into the municipal sewage system along with patient excreta. Studies have shown that the majority of antibiotics pass through sewage treatment and are then released into the environment. Accordingly, investigations conducted in various countries have detected a number of antibiotics in the low $\mu$g or ng per litre range in different environmental compartments. Studies connecting mass balances of use on a local scale and of input and analysis of the antibiotic concentrations present in municipal sewage treatment plants are scarce. Data on local use of antibiotics and their relation to nationwide consumption are not available. This study investigated the use, input, and fate of antibiotics on a local scale and this data were compared with the German nationwide consumption. 42 antibiotics and 15 antimycotics were used in the mass balance consideration over a period of one year. It was found that the local pattern of usage differed only little from that found nationwide. Seasonal changes were minor and the concentrations actually measured were found to be in the expected range. Differences in both the identified occurrence and the concentrations of the target compounds were observed within and between the three sampling periods. {\textcopyright} 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {Antineoplastic agents are applied in cancer therapy and end up in hospital wastewater by human excretions. In this study, the raw wastewater of the sewer of the oncologic in-patient treatment ward of the Vienna University Hospital was monitored for 98 d over 2 years for the cytostatics 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin (DOX), epirubicin, and daunorubicin. In a next step, the elimination of the drugs by a membrane-bio-reactor system was investigated. In addition, their fate in wastewater and elimination by activated sludge was investigated with radio-labelled substances. During the monitoring periods, concentration levels ranging from {\textless}8.6 to 124 $\mu$g l-1 for 5-FU and from {\textless}0.26 to 1.35 $\mu$g l-1 for DOX were determined. The concentrations analysed fitted the lower ranges calculated by an input-output model. Treatment of oncologic wastewater in the membrane bio-reactor as well as the analysis of the effluents of the Vienna University Hospital resulted in concentrations below the limit of detection. Investigations with radio-labelled compounds showed that 5-FU is eliminated from the liquid phase below the limit of detection. But, up to 25{\%} of radio-labelled equivalents of the drug's amount were found in the gaseous phase and only a marginal part in the solid phase, this indicates that at least one part of the drug is biodegraded. For the anthracyclines more than 90{\%} was eliminated from the liquid phase. In this case, adsorption to suspended solids seems to be the major elimination pathway, as up to 30{\%} of the radio-labelled equivalents of the drug's amount was detected in the solid phase. Our results indicate that the investigated anticancer drugs are eliminated by sewage treatment plants, either by biodegradation or adsorption. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cytostatic anticancer drugs are an increasingly important issue in the environmental debate, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the fate of these toxic substances. Over the last decades, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has been one of the most frequently used antineoplastic agents and may, therefore, be regarded as one of the pilot substances for environmental contamination. As a prerequisite for these investigations, a method for the determination of 5-FU in hospital effluents has been developed. Waste water samples were enriched by solid-phase extraction on ENV+ columns (concentration factor 500) and analysed by capillary electrophoresis using a buffer containing 80{\%} 160 mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9.5) and 20{\%} acetonitrile (v/v). This method is applicable within the range 5-500 $\mu$g 5-FU L-1. The standard curve (correlation coefficient {\textgreater}0.99) was linear with recovery rates from 80 to 96{\%} and an accuracy from 9.0 to 20{\%} (intra-assay standard deviation 0.7-8.9{\%}; inter-assay standard deviation 2.2-9.5{\%}). Based on the consumption of 5-FU in oncologic departments and the detection limit of 1.7 $\mu$g L-1, this method covers the range necessary to evaluate 5-FU in hospital effluents. The applicability of the method was proven by chemical analysis of real hospital waste water samples. Obtained over a time period of 1 month (range 20-122 $\mu$g 5-FU L-1), the results were similar to those calculated by an input-output model. The presented method provides an analytical tool necessary to face the monitoring of environmental contamination problems. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

In this study, samples of hospital effluents and WWTP influents and effluents from Slovenia and Spain were analyzed for twenty-two selected anticancer drugs, their metabolites and transformation products. Acute and chronic toxicity tests were performed on the crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia, genotoxicity was determined with Tradescantia and Allium cepa micronucleus (MN) assays and in vitro comet assay in zebrafish (Danio rerio) liver cell line (ZFL cells). Sixty of the two hundred-twenty determinations revealed detectable levels of anticancer drug residues. Among the targeted compounds, platinum based were most frequently detected (90{\%}). Furthermore, erlotinib was detected in 80{\%}, cyclophosphamide and tamoxifen in 70{\%} and methotrexate in 60{\%} of the samples. Seven of ten samples were toxic to C. dubia after acute exposure, whereas after chronic exposure all samples reduced reproduction of C. dubia at high sample dilutions. Allium cepa proved insensitive to the potential genotoxicity of the tested samples, while in Tradescantia increased MN frequencies were induced by a hospital effluent and WWTP influents. In ZFL comet assay all but one sample induced a significant increase of DNA strand breaks. Correlations of chemotherapeutics or their TPs were detected for all bioassays except for Allium cepa genotoxicity test, however for each test the highest correlations were found for different substances indicating differential sensitivities of the test organisms.},

abstract = {The continuous release of pharmaceuticals from WWTP effluents to freshwater is a matter of concern, due to their potential effects on non-target organisms. The occurrence of pharmaceuticals in WWTPs and their associated hazard have been scarcely studied in Latin American countries. This study aimed at monitoring for the first time the occurrence of 70 pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) in WWTPs across Costa Rica; the application of the hazard quotient (HQ) approach coupled to ecotoxicological determinations permitted to identify the hazard posed by specific pharmaceuticals and toxicity of the effluents, respectively. Thirty-three PhACs were found, with 1,7-dimethylxanthine, caffeine, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen and gemfibrozil being the most frequently detected (influents/effluents). HQ for specific pharmaceuticals revealed 24 compounds with high/medium hazard in influents, while the amount only decreased to 21 in effluents. The top HQ values were obtained for risperidone, lovastatin, diphenhydramine and fluoxetine (influent/effluent samples), plus caffeine (influent) and trimethoprim (effluent). Likewise, the estimation of overall hazard in WWTP samples (sum of individual HQ, ∑HQ) demonstrated that every influent and 96{\%} of the effluents presented high hazard towards aquatic organisms. Ecotoxicological analysis (Daphnia magna, Lactuca sativa and Microtox test) revealed that 16.7{\%} of the effluents presented toxicity towards all benchmark organisms; the phytotoxicity was particularly frequent, as inhibition values ≥20{\%} in the germination index for L. sativa were obtained for all the effluents. The ∑HQ approach estimated the highest hazard in urban wastewater, while the ecotoxicological results showed the highest toxicity in hospital and landfill wastewater. Likewise, ecotoxicological results and ∑HQ values showed a rather poor correlation; instead, better correlations were obtained between ecotoxicological parameters and HQ values for some individual pharmaceuticals such as cephalexin and diphenhydramine. Findings from this study provide novel information on the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and the performance of WWTPs in the tropical region of Central America.},

The most ubiquitous contaminants in the sewage water were analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen (14.6-31.3 $\mu$g/L) and acetaminophen (7.1-11.4 $\mu$g/L), antibiotic ofloxacin (0.89-31.7 $\mu$g/L), lipid regulators gemfibrozil (2.0-5.9 $\mu$g/L) and bezafibrate (1.9-29.8 $\mu$g/L), $\beta$-blocker atenolol (0.84-2.8 $\mu$g/L), hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide (0.12-15.9 $\mu$g/L) and a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (2.3-4.8 $\mu$g/L). Also, several pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, diclofenac, ofloxacin and azithromycin were detected in sewage sludge at concentrations up to 741.1, 336.3, 380.7, 454.7 and 299.6 ng/g dry weight. Two pilot-scale MBRs exhibited enhanced elimination of several pharmaceutical residues poorly removed by the CAS treatment (e.g., mefenamic acid, indomethacin, diclofenac, propyphenazone, pravastatin, gemfibrozil), whereas in some cases more stable operation of one of the MBR reactors at prolonged SRT proved to be detrimental for the elimination of some compounds (e.g., $\beta$-blockers, ranitidine, famotidine, erythromycin). Moreover, the anti-epileptic drug carbamazepine and diuretic hydrochlorothiazide by-passed all three treatments investigated. Furthermore, sorption to sewage sludge in the MBRs as well as in the entire treatment line of a full-scale WWTP is discussed for the encountered analytes. Among the pharmaceuticals encountered in sewage sludge, sorption to sludge could be a relevant removal pathway only for several compounds (i.e., mefenamic acid, propranolol, and loratidine). Especially in the case of loratidine the experimentally determined sorption coefficients (Kds) were in the range 2214-3321 L/kg (mean). The results obtained for the solid phase indicated that MBR wastewater treatment yielding higher biodegradation rate could reduce the load of pollutants in the sludge. Also, the overall output load in the aqueous and solid phase of the investigated WWTP was calculated, indicating that none of the residual pharmaceuticals initially detected in the sewage sludge were degraded during the anaerobic digestion. Out of the 26 pharmaceutical residues passing through the WWTP, 20 were ultimately detected in the treated sludge that is further applied on farmland. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Growth and activity of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor on sewage sludge were assessed in bioslurry and solid-phase systems. Bioslurry cultures with different loads of sludge (10{\%}, 25{\%} and 38{\%}, w/v) were performed. A lag phase of at least 2 d appeared in the 25 and 38{\%}-cultures, however, the total fungal biomass was higher for the latter and lower for the 10{\%}-culture after 30 d, as revealed by ergosterol determination. Detectable laccase activity levels were found in the 10 and 25{\%}-cultures (up to 1308 and 2588 AU L-1, respectively) while it was negligible in the 38{\%}-culture. Important levels of ergosterol and laccase were obtained over a 60 d period in sludge solid-phase cultures amended with different concentrations of wheat straw pellets as lignocellulosic bulking material. Degradation experiments in 25{\%}-bioslurry cultures spiked with naproxene (NAP, analgesic) and carbamazepine (CBZ, antiepileptic) showed depletion of around 47{\%} and 57{\%} within 24 h, respectively. Complete depletion of NAP and around 48{\%} for CBZ were achieved within 72 h in sludge solid cultures with 38{\%} bulking material. CBZ degradation is especially remarkable due to its high persistence in wastewater treatment plants. Results showed that T. versicolor may be an interesting bioremediation agent for elimination of emerging pollutants in sewage sludge. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {For safe biosolid-land-applying, sludge should be contaminant-free. However, it may contain important amounts of micropollutants, not removed in the wastewater-treatment-processes. An alternative treatment with the fungus Trametes versicolor was applied in sterile solid-phase systems consisting of sludge and a lignocellulosic substrate. Fungal colonization and activity were demonstrated during the process, according to monitoring of ergosterol, laccase activity and the naproxen-degradation test (ND24). Fourteen out of 43 analyzed pharmaceuticals were found in the raw sludge. After treatment, phenazone, bezafibrate, fenofibrate, cimetidine, clarithromycin, sulfamethazine and atenolol were completely removed, while removals between 42{\%} and 80{\%} were obtained for the remaining pharmaceuticals. Toxicological analyses (Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri and seed germination) showed an important reduction in sludge toxicity after treatment. Results suggest that a solid-phase treatment with T. versicolor may reduce the ecotoxicological impact of micropollutants present in sewage sludge. This is the first report of a fungal-approach for elimination of emerging pollutants from biosolids. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This study investigated the applicability of fluorescence indexes based on the interpretation of excitation emission matrices (EEMs) by PARAFAC analysis and by selecting fluorescence intensities at a priori defined excitation/emission pairs as surrogates for monitoring the behavior of emerging organic compounds (EOCs) in two catchment basins impacted by wastewater discharges. Relevant EOC and EEM data were obtained for a 90 km stretch of the Simeto River, the main river in Sicily, and the smaller San Leonardo River, which was investigated for a 17 km stretch. The use of fluorescence indexes developed by these two different approaches resulted in similar observations. Changes of the fluorescence indexes that correspond to a group of humic-like fluorescing species were determined to be highly correlated with the concentrations of recalcitrant contaminants such as sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine, which are typical wastewater markers in river water. Changes of the fluorescence indexes related to tyrosine-like substances were well correlated with the concentrations of ibuprofen and caffeine, anthropogenic indicators of untreated wastewater discharges. Chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were correlated with humic-like fluorescence indexes. The observed correlations were site-specific and characterized by different regression parameters for every collection event. Caffeine and carbamazepine showed correlations with florescence indexes in the San Leonardo River and in the alluvial plain stretch of the Simeto River, whereas sucralose, sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen have always been well correlated in all the investigated river stretches. However, when data of different collection events from river stretches where correlations were observed were combined, good linear correlations were obtained for data sets generated via the normalization of the measured concentrations by the average value for the corresponding collection event. These results show that fluorescence based indexes can be used to monitor the behavior of some trace organic contaminants in wastewater impacted rivers and to track wastewater discharges in streams and rivers.},

abstract = {This work reports a systematic survey of over seventy individual pollutants in a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) receiving urban wastewater. The compounds include mainly pharmaceuticals and personal care products, as well as some metabolites. The quantification in the ng/L range was performed by Liquid Chromatography-QTRAP-Mass Spectrometry and Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry. The results showed that paraxanthine, caffeine and acetaminophen were the main individual pollutants usually found in concentrations over 20 ppb. N-formyl-4-amino-antipiryne and galaxolide were also detected in the ppb level. A group of compounds including the beta-blockers atenolol, metoprolol and propanolol; the lipid regulators bezafibrate and fenofibric acid; the antibiotics erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, the antiinflammatories diclofenac, indomethacin, ketoprofen and mefenamic acid, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antiacid omeprazole exhibited removal efficiencies below 20{\%} in the STP treatment. Ozonation with doses lower than 90 $\mu$M allowed the removal of many individual pollutants including some of those more refractory to biological treatment. A kinetic model allowed the determination of second order kinetic constants for the ozonation of bezafibrate, cotinine, diuron and metronidazole. The results show that the hydroxyl radical reaction was the major pathway for the oxidative transformation of these compounds. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Emerging contaminants, such as antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, and artificial sweeteners, are recognized as new classes of water contaminants due to their proven or potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health. This review provides comprehensive data on the occurrence of 60 emerging contaminants (ECs) in influent, treated effluent, sludge, and biosolids in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In particular, data on the occurrence of ECs in the influents and effluents of WWTPs are systematically summarized and categorized according to geographical regions (Asia, Europe, and North America). The occurrence patterns of ECs in raw influent and treated effluents of WWTPs between geographical regions were compared and evaluated. Concentrations of most ECs in raw influent in Asian region tend to be higher than those in European and North American countries. Many antibiotics were detected in the influents and effluents of WWTPs at concentrations close to or exceeding the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for resistance selection. The efficacy of EC removal by sorption and biodegradation during wastewater treatment processes are discussed in light of kinetics and parameters, such as sorption coefficients (Kd) and biodegradation constants (kbiol), and physicochemical properties (i.e. log Kow and pKa). Commonly used sampling and monitoring strategies are critically reviewed. Analytical research needs are identified, and novel investigative approaches for future monitoring studies are proposed.},

The sludge synthesis yield being 0.4-0.6 kgVSS/kgCOD (0.57-0.8 kgCODcell/kgCOD), results in high power consumption on its digestion and therefore taken considerable attention to achieve sustainable strategies.Solids reduction by physico-chemical methods results in buildup of chemicals. This may present risk to the environment and may require further treatment to remove the chemicals of concern in future. Wastewater sludge reduction upto 100{\%} by biological, sustainable, non-hazardous, and environment friendly methods has been successfully tested at different levels. Therefore, above reasons were sufficient driving forces to confine this review to non-chemically assisted processes. Similarly, the thermally assisted processes result in high carbon footprint and excluded from the scope of this review. Enough has been reviewed on sludge reduction, as numbers of articles on the same subject with different angles have been reported, still the progress in the last few years is missing; hence, special emphasis is given herewith to highlight the efforts of the last five years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The presence of sewage-borne micro contaminants in environmental waters is directly related to the discharge of treated effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and the flow rate of the receiving river waters. Mediterranean rivers, in particular, are characterized by important fluctuations in the flow rates and heavy pollution pressures resulting from extensive urban, industrial and agricultural activities. This translates into contamination levels in these rivers often higher than those in other larger European basins. The present work provides an overview of the occurrence of five groups of organic contaminants (131 compounds) namely pharmaceuticals, illicit drugs, polar pesticides, estrogens, alkylphenols and related ethoxylates in WWTP tertiary treatment effluents. Data gathered during a period of water reuse carried out in the lower stretch of the Llobregat river (NE Spain), in the surroundings of the town of Barcelona as a consequence of the severe drought that took place along the years 2007-2008 are presented as illustrative example. In general, measured concentrations of the target compounds were in the low to mid ngL-1 range. The total concentration of each compound class downstream to the discharge point was similar or slightly higher than that found upstream. Regarding the loads calculated for each compound, the relative contribution from the river upstream and the tertiary effluent were highly compound depending with no apparent trend. However, estimation of the overall bulk loads for each compound class determined in the Llobregat river showed the following rank order: pharmaceuticals{\textgreater}alkylphenols{\textgreater}pesticides{\textgreater}illicit drugs≫estrogens. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective. There is growing concern about bacterial resistance to antimicrobials. The majority of antibiotics used are only partially metabolized after administration, and are released via patient excreta into the municipal sewage system. Data on the use of antibiotics and their emission into hospital effluent are not available. Methods. Antibiotic consumption in Germany was calculated on the basis of five hospitals of varying size and medical service spectrum and on prescriptions issued by medical practitioners. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was calculated for hospital effluent and for municipal sewage. The PECs were compared both with published minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC50) for sensitive pathogenic bacteria and with the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs). Results. The amount of antibiotics emitted into hospital effluent may reach and exceed the MIC50 of susceptible pathogenic bacteria. The PEC/PNEC ratio is highest for hospital effluent (in some cases 10-20 times the MIC50) and frequently {\textgreater}1 for municipal sewage. PECs are high enough for some compounds to have a PEC/PNEC ratio {\textgreater}1 even in surface water. Conclusion. The volume of antibiotics used in hospitals and private households and released into effluent and municipal sewage indicates a selection pressure on bacteria. Steps should be taken to reduce the risk by proper handling of antibiotics and their residues both in hospitals and by private users.},

The interaction between three variables was studied and modelled for four responses: chromium, copper, dyes (mixture of Acid Blue 161 and Pigment Orange 34) removal and biomass production. The results showed that yeast extract had a significant effect on Cu(II) removal (87.6mgL-1) and biomass production while dye removal was significantly affected by the combination of nutrients.

abstract = {A promising biological, sustainable, non-hazardous, safe and environmental friendly management and disposal technique of domestic wastewater sludge is global expectation. Fungal entrapped biosolids as a result of prior fungal treated raw wastewater sludge was recycled to evaluate its performance as inoculum for bioseparation/bioconversion of supplemented sludge in view of continuous as well as scale up wastewater sludge treatment. Encouraging results were achieved in bioseparation of suspended solids and in dewaterability/filterability of treated domestic wastewater sludge. Fungal entrapped biosolids offered 98{\%} removal of total suspended solids (TSS) in supplemented sludge treatment at 6-day without nutrient (wheat flour, WF) supply. Consequently, 99{\%} removal of turbidity and 87{\%} removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) were achieved in supernatant of treated sludge. The lowest value (1.75 × 1012 m/kg) of specific resistance to filtration (SRF) was observed at 6-day after treatment, which was equivalent to the 70{\%} decrease of SRF. The all results except SRF were not influenced further in treatments accompanied with WF supplementation. The present treatments offered significant (P ≤ 0.01) improvement in all results except SRF of treated wastewater sludge compared to the control. Furthermore, the present result is addressing a potential avenue of probable solution for expected management and disposal of domestic wastewater sludge in future. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Low levels of pharmaceuticals are detected in surface, ground, and drinking water worldwide. Usage and incorrect disposal have been considered the major environmental sources of these microcontaminants. Recent publications, however, suggest that wastewater from drug production can potentially be a source of much higher concentrations in certain locations. The present study investigated the environmental fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a major production area for the global bulk drug market. Water samples were taken from a common effluent treatment plant near Hyderabad, India, which receives process water from approximately 90 bulk drug manufacturers. Surface water was analyzed from the recipient stream and from two lakes that are not contaminated by the treatment plant. Water samples were also taken from wells in six nearby villages. The samples were analyzed for the presence of 12 pharmaceuticals with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. All wells were determined to be contaminated with drugs. Ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, cetirizine, terbinafine, and Citalopram were detected at more than 1 $\mu$g/L in several wells. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (14 mg/L) and cetirizine (2.1 mg/L) were found in the effluent of the treatment plant, together with high concentrations of seven additional pharmaceuticals. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (up to 6.5 mg/L), cetirizine (up to 1.2 mg/L), norfloxacin (up to 0.52 mg/L), and enoxacin (up to 0.16 mg/L) were also detected in the two lakes, which clearly shows that the investigated area has additional environmental sources of insufficiently treated industrial waste. Thus, insufficient wastewater management in one of the world's largest centers for bulk drug production leads to unprecedented drug contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water. This raises serious concerns regarding the development of antibiotic resistance, and it creates a major challenge for producers and regulatory agencies to improve the situation. {\textcopyright} 2009 SETAC.},

abstract = {Cytostatic drugs, used in chemotherapy, are excreted unchanged by urine and feces or modified as metabolites. Elimination of these drugs in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is often incomplete and residues reach surface water. Their presence in the natural environment depends on consumption patterns, excretion fraction and the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment. This study compiled the total consumption of cytostatic drugs in Catalonia (NE Spain) and provides data on the occurrence and risk of anticancer drugs in the aquatic environment by calculating predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). PECs were estimated using publicly available consumption data in the period of 2010-2012, published or calculated excretion values and wastewater elimination rates for a suite of 132 compounds. This allows predicting the range of concentrations in effluent wastewaters and receiving waters. Out of the 132 cytostatics, mycophenolic acid and hydroxycarbamide had a PEC value higher than 10ngL-1. PECs were compared with MECs (measured environmental concentrations) to evaluate the reliability of the estimation. A risk assessment was conducted to determine the potential adverse effects of cytostatics in the environment. All the risk quotients calculated using EC50 in Daphnia magna were below 1, showing no significant risk.},

abstract = {The presence and fate of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in the environment is undergoing increasing scrutiny. The existing clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data for 81 common compounds were examined for cues of ecotoxicity. Of these the proportions excreted were available for 60 compounds (i.e., 74{\%}). The compounds had a low (≤0.5{\%}), a moderately low (6-39{\%}), a relatively high (40-69{\%}), or a high (≥70{\%}) proportion of the parent compound excreted. More than half of the compounds evaluated have low or moderately low proportions of the parent compound excreted. However, the proportions excreted were negatively but moderately correlated (r=-0.50; n=13; P=0.08) with the concentrations of the compounds in the aquatic environment, suggesting that the compounds that have low proportions excreted may also have inherently low degradability in the environment. Solubility, log Kow, and pKa work well in predicting the behavior of PPCPs under clinical conditions and have been used in the environmental assessment of PPCPs prior to approval. However, these parameters did not correlate with the proportion of PPCPs excreted in the environment or their concentration in the environment, underscoring the need for research into the behavior of PPCPs in the environment. PPCPs occur in low concentrations in the environment and are unlikely to elicit acute toxicity. An ecotoxicity potential that is based on chronic toxicity, bioavailability, and duration of exposure to nontarget organisms is described as a guide in assessing the potency of these compounds in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Environmental analytical studies show that trace concentrations of antibacterial agents (antibiotics) occur in hospital and municipal wastewaters and in the aquatic environment. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides, two important human-use antibiotic classes, were studied in detail. The results are discussed regarding input sources and behavior in wastewater treatment and rivers. The fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are substantially eliminated in wastewater treatment (80-90{\%}) by sorption transfer to sewage sludge. In digested sludges the fluoroquinolones occur at mg/kg levels. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are further removed in the Glatt river by 66 and 48{\%}, respectively. The most abundant macrolide clarithromycin was detected at 57 to 330 ng/l concentrations in treated wastewater effluents. Different compositions of the macrolides (clarithromycin and erythromycin-H2O) determined in treated effluents of three wastewater treatment plants can be explained by distinct consumption patterns, in one case due to an international airport located in the catchment area. Residual levels of clarithromycin in the Glatt river were up to 75 ng/l with no apparent removal in the river. These results provide important information on environmental exposures, which can be incorporated into environmental risk assessments of the particular chemicals.},

abstract = {In a long term study, which covered 4 sampling periods over three years, a total number of 84 samples, specifically 28 influent, effluent, from seven WWTP located in the main cities along the Ebro river Basin (North East of Spain), as well as receiving river waters, were analyzed to assess the occurrence of 73 pharmaceuticals covering several medicinal classes. Results indicated that pharmaceuticals are widespread pollutants in the aquatic environmental. Linking the calculation of removal rates with half-lives, assuming that compound degradation followed pseudo-first order kinetics, suggested that conventional wastewater treatments applied at the seven WWTP were unable to completely remove most of the pharmaceuticals under study. The evaluation of compound degradability, in terms of half-lives, is an important task to discuss integrated solutions for mitigation of pollutants entry into the water cycle. High half-lives observed for the majority of pharmaceuticals in WWTP suggest that, in order to enhance compound degradation, higher hydraulic retention times should be required. The wide spectrum of substances detected in receiving river waters indicates that WWTP outlets are major contributors of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. However, municipal wastewater treatment represents an obligatory and final treatment step prior to their release into the aquatic media, since load of pharmaceuticals in outlets were considerably reduced after treatment. Finally, hazard posed by pharmaceuticals in both surface and effluent wastewaters was assessed toward different aquatic organisms, (algae, daphnids and fish). The overall relative order of susceptibility was estimated to be algae {\textgreater} daphnia {\textgreater} fish. Results indicate that no significant risks could be associated to the presence of pharmaceuticals in those matrices, indicating that reduction of compound concentration after wastewater treatment as well as dilution factor once pharmaceuticals are discharged in receiving river water efficiently mitigate possible environmental hazards. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the relatively new introduction or detection of these pollutants, there exists a gap in the knowledge on their fate, behaviors and effects, as well as on treatment technologies for their efficient removal. Furthermore, despite the advances in treatment technologies, the design of existing treatment plants are not suited to remove these ECs, in addition to there being a lack of published health standards that provide guideline in treating these pollutants. Many new ECs are being introduced into the environment without detection. In these context, this paper reviews existing research that provide reliable and quantitative information on pharmaceuticals, PCPs and EDCs and their concentrations in surface water, ground water, drinking water and treated wastewater and the removal efficiency of different treatment processes for different emerging pollutants, with a focus on recent studies regarding the fate and behavior of the contaminants in wastewater treatment plants and in the environment as well. The paper also highlights various biological and chemical treatment techniques and their drawbacks. Also, this review discusses the scope of future research on ECs.},

abstract = {The OECD Halden Reactor Project (HRP) has taken an active role in advancing condition monitoring techniques for maintenance support. Model-Based Condition Monitoring (MBCM) is one such technique that includes physical modelling, empirical modelling, and knowledge-based modelling. The potential of MBCM to provide advanced monitoring and diagnostic functionality has been demonstrated in many studies, pilot projects, and industrial small-scale applications. The Thermal Performance Monitoring and Optimisation (TEMPO) system has been developed at the HRP and utilizes MBCM for balance of plant simulation. The data-reconciliation method used in TEMPO relies on fitting a simulation of the turbine cycle to the actual plant data. The difference between measurements and calculated values (residuals) are monitored to detect deviations. Each measurement point is assigned an uncertainty. How well the simulation fits to the measurements is compared to the given uncertainty. Traditionally this comparison is directly used to determine if there is a fault in the measurement. By using a time series analysis of plant data, changes below single point statistical significance can be found. Variations in both individual residuals and the global object function, i.e. the sum of all residuals, are small and their values mostly static. Thus, trending the global object function value is important in order to identify possible faults. Comparing residuals with past behaviour enhances fault detection compared with a statistical analysis of each data point.},

abstract = {White rot fungi have been studied for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern from wastewater during the last decade. However, several issues need to be overcome for its plausible implementation at full-scale installations such as the addition of supplementary substrates, the partial re-inoculation of fresh fungi or the use of extended hydraulic retention times. This work proposes the immobilization of Trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors at bench scale (flowrates of 10 L/d and reactor capacity of 10 L) for the treatment of different urban wastewater. This type of bioreactor achieved remarkable reductions of the total organic carbon loading of the wastewater (70–75{\%}) in a wide range of C:N and C:P ratios with limited addition of supplementary substrates, non-refreshment of the fungal biomass and only 1-day of hydraulic retention. The addition of gallic acid as quinone-like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes increased the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants mediated by the so-called advanced bio-oxidation process. The immobilization of Trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors also showed a remarkable stabilization of the fungi during the continuous treatment of different urban wastewater under non-sterile conditions. Thus, this system is a sound alternative for biological urban wastewater treatment with pharmaceutical removal because overcome all the problems usually associated with the water treatment technologies based on white rot fungi that makes difficult the scaling-up of the process and its implementation in full scale wastewater treatment plants.},

These canals were monitored upstream and downstream of the effluent discharge points in order to evaluate the effluent impact on the quality of surface waters, commonly used for irrigation. An environmental risk assessment was also conducted by calculating the risk quotient, i.e. the ratio between measured concentration and predicted no effect concentration.Collected data show that, although average values of the selected compounds were in general higher in the effluent than in the surface waters, some compounds not detected in the WWTP effluent were detected in the receiving water (upstream as well as downstream), indicating that sources other than treated effluents are present as contaminations during extraction and analysis have to be excluded. The most critical compounds for the environment were found to be the antibiotics sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin and azithromycin. The study shows that the potential toxicological effects of persistent micropollutants can be mitigated to some extent by a high dilution capacity, i.e. a high average flow rate in the receiving water body with respect to the effluent. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent investigations have mainly referred to the occurrence and loads of suspended solids, organic compounds and, in some cases, micropollutants. Attempts have been made to find correlations between the discharged load and the size and characteristics of the catchment area, climate conditions, rainfall duration and intensity. This study refers to a touristic coastal area in the north-east of Italy, which is characterized by a combined sewer network including 5 CSO outfalls which, in the case of heavy rain events, directly discharge the exceeding water flow rate into channels which, after a short distance, reach the Adriatic Sea. The study analyzed: i) rainfall events during the summer period in 2014 which led to overflow in the different outfalls, ii) the inter- and intra-event variability with regard to E. coli, Enterococci and conductivity, and iii) the hydraulic and pollutant (E. coli and Enterococci) loads discharged by the local wastewater treatment plant and by all the CSO outfalls. Finally, it estimated the contribution of each source to the released hydraulic and pollutant loads into the receiving water body. Moreover, it was also found that the modest water volume discharged by all CSO outfalls (only 8{\%} of the total volume discharged by the area) contains {\textgreater} 90{\%} of the microbial load.},

This spectrum of chemicals, however, is only one piece of the larger puzzle in ″holistic″ risk assessment. Another diverse group of bioactive chemicals receiving comparatively little attention as potential environmental pollutants includes the pharmaceuticals and active ingredients in personal care products (in this review collectively termed PPCPs), both human and veterinary, including not just prescription drugs and biologics, but also diagnostic agents, ″nutraceuticals,″ fragrances, sun-screen agents, and numerous others. These compounds and their bioactive metabolites can be continually introduced to the aquatic environment as complex mixtures via a number of routes but primarily by both untreated and treated sewage. Aquatic pollution is particularly troublesome because aquatic organisms are captive to continual life-cycle, multigenerational exposure. The possibility for continual but undetectable or unnoticed effects on aquatic organisms is particularly worrisome because effects could accumulate so slowly that major change goes undetected until the cumulative level of these effects finally cascades to irreversible change - change that would otherwise be attributed to natural adaptation or ecologic succession. As opposed to the conventional, persistent priority pollutants, PPCPs need not be persistent if they are continually introduced to surface waters, even at low parts-per-trillion/parts-per-billion concentrations (ng-$\mu$g/L). Even though some PPCPs are extremely persistent and introduced to the environment in very high quantities and perhaps have already gained ubiquity worldwide, others could act as if they were persistent, simply because their continual infusion into the aquatic environment serves to sustain perpetual life-cycle exposures for aquatic organisms. This review attempts to synthesize the literature on environmental origin, distribution/occurrence, and effects and to catalyze a more focused discussion in the environmental science community.},

abstract = {A white rot fungus Phlebia tremellosa produced lignin degrading enzymes, which showed degrading activity against various recalcitrant compounds. However, manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity, one of lignin degrading enzymes, was very low in this fungus under various culture conditions. An expression vector that carried both the laccase and MnP genes was constructed using laccase genomic DNA of P. tremellosa and MnP cDNA from Polyporus brumalis. P. tremellosa was genetically transformed using the expression vector to obtain fungal transformants showing increased laccase and MnP activity. Many transformants showed highly increased laccase and MnP activity at the same time in liquid medium, and three of them were used to degrade endocrine disrupting chemicals. The transformant not only degraded bisphenol A and nonylphenol more rapidly but also removed the estrogenic activities of the chemicals faster than the wild type strain. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Microbiological Society of Korea and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The contamination of water by organic pollutants viz. phenolic compounds (phenol, 2-chlorophenol (2-CPh) and 4-chlorophenol (4-CPh)) is a worldwide environmental problem due to their highly toxic nature. The use of non-living Schizophyllum commune fungus (S. commune fungus) to remove phenol, 2-CPh and 4-CPh from water under equilibrium and column flow experimental conditions was evaluated. The resulting biosorbent was characterized by BET surface area analysis, Fourier transformer infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The effect of experimental parameters such as effect of pH, contact time, initial concentration of adsorbate and amount of biosorbent dosage was evaluated. The experimental data were fitted to various isotherm models. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of S. commune fungus for phenol, 2-CPh and 4-CPh was found to be 120, 178 and 244. mg/g, respectively, at 25 ± 2 °C according to Langmuir model. The equilibrium time was found to be 2. h for all adsorbates to complete saturation. Kinetic studies showed the adsorption process followed pseudo second-order kinetic model. The column regeneration studies were carried out for three adsorption-desorption cycles. The eluant used for the regeneration of the adsorbent was 0.1. M NaOH. Based on the results obtained such as good uptake capacity, rapid kinetics, and its low cost, S. commune fungus appears to be a promising biosorbent material for the removal of phenolic compounds from aqueous media. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds are a major source of concern due to their resistance to degradation and persistency in the environment. Xenobiotic compounds pose a serious threat to the environment as they tend to distort the nutrient cycling and affect non-target organisms. These recalcitrant compounds include heavy metals, halocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, polycyclic aromatic compounds, synthetic polymers, alkyl benzyl sulphonates, nitroaromatics, dioxins, synthetic dyes, chlorophenols, certain herbicides and pesticides as well as lignins that are ubiquitous in nature. Xenobiotic compounds find their way into the environment either through intentional release as happens with pesticides and herbicides spray or accidentally in the form of oil spills and persist as sediments and complexes, thereby reducing the quality of soil and water bodies and consequently creating the need for removal and/or remediation processes. White rot fungi which degrade the most recalcitrant natural polymer, lignin, have been shown to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant xenobiotic compounds. Recently, the use of co-cultures of white rot has been a subject of research. Owing to the variation in the ligninolytic machinery and rates of degradation, the use of co-cultures is attractive as it offers the advantage of combining the degradative capabilities of different fungi to bring about complete degradation of the parent compounds as well as the metabolites.},

This study analyzes the presence of antibiotics in potable water from two treatment plants in Baghdad City. The collected samples were separated using a solid-phase extraction method with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge before being analyzed. The detected antibiotics in the raw and finished drinking water were analyzed and assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with fluorometric detector and UV detector. The results confirmed that different antibiotics including fluoroquinolones and B- lactams were detected in the raw and finished water. The most frequently detected antibiotics were ciprofloxacin with highest concentration of 1.270 $\mu$ g L −1 in the raw water of Al-Wihda plant, whereas the highest concentration of levofloxacin was 0.177 $\mu$ g L −1 , while amoxicillin was not detected in this plant. In contrast, ciprofloxacin was found in both raw water and finished water of Al-Rasheed plant and recorded highest concentration of 1.344 and 1.312 $\mu$ g L −1 , respectively. Moreover, the residual amount of levofloxacin in the raw water was up to 0.414 $\mu$ g L −1 , whereas amoxicillin was shown to be the most detectable drug in the raw water of Al-Rasheed plant, with a concentration of 1.50 $\mu$ g L −1 . The results of this study revealed the existence of antibiotic drugs in raw and finished water and should be included in the Iraqi standard for drinking water quality assessment. },

Whereas IBU was extensively degraded by all the fungi tested, T. versicolor was the only strain able to degrade either CLOFI (∼91{\%}) and CARBA (∼58{\%}), although the latter was also degraded by G. lucidum (∼47{\%}). In vitro experiments using manganese peroxidase and laccase-mediator system showed that extracellular fungal enzyme systems did not appear to play a role in the first step of degradation. However, our in vivo studies using the cytochrome P450 inhibitors 1-aminobenzotriazole and piperonyl butoxide suggested that the cytochrome P450 system may be involved in the first step of CLOFI and CARBA oxidation by T. versicolor. During the very early stages of IBU degradation by T. versicolor, two hydroxylated metabolites were detected: 1-hydroxy ibuprofen and 2-hydroxy ibuprofen. These byproducts were subsequently degraded by the fungus to 1,2-dihydroxy ibuprofen, that was not reported in biological systems to date. Furthermore, these results are of particular interest because CLOFI and CARBA are highly persistent in the aquatic environment and they pass unchanged or poorly transformed in wastewater treatment plants. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To evaluate the ecotoxicological potential of ten prescription drugs against aquatic organisms from different taxonornical classes, a set of biotests were performed using the cladoceran Daphnia magna, the chlorophyte Desmodesmus subspicatus and the macrophyte Lemna minor. Endpoints were immobilisation for Daphnia and inhibition of the average growth rate for Desmodesmus and Lemna. For most of the substances, toxicities were moderate, with EC50s in the range from 10 to 100 mgl-1 or even far above, whereas Lemna was the most sensitive test species in the majority of all tested compounds. Tests with combinations of various pharmaceuticals revealed stronger effects than expected from the effects measured singly. Clofibrinic acid and Carbamazepine have been found to act by a non-specific mode of action (non-polar narcosis), and with Daphnia the combination effect of these substances followed the concept of concentration addition, while in the algae test the concept of independent action could be used to calculate the mixture toxicity. The anti-inflammatory drugs Diclofenac and Ibuprofen have also been found to act unspecific by non-polar narcosis and to follow the concept of concentration addition in the algal test as well as in the Daphnia test. The measured toxicities of the tested pharmaceuticals shows that acute effect of single substances in the aquatic environment are very unlikely. But we should keep in mind that considerable combination effects can occur and that toxicity data from chronic studies are needed to assess the environmental risk of drug residues. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Toxicities were relatively low, with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values obtained using Daphnia in the range from 68 to 166mgL-1 and from 72 to 626mgL-1 in the algal test. Acute effects of these substances seem to be quite improbable. The quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) approach showed that all substances act by nonpolar narcosis; thus, the higher the n-octanol/water partitioning coefficient (logKow) of the substances, the higher is their toxicity. Mixture toxicity of the compounds could be accurately predicted using the concept of concentration addition. Toxicity of the mixture was considerable, even at concentrations at which the single substances showed no or only very slight effects, with some deviations in the Daphnia test, which could be explained by incompatibility of the very steep dose-response curves and the probit analysis of the data. Because pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment occur usually as mixtures, an accurate prediction of the mixture toxicity is indispensable for environmental risk assessment. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Aims: To test the potential use of Phanerochaete chrysosporium and other white-rot fungi to detoxify olive mill wastewaters (OMW) in the presence of a complex activated sludge. To combine the aerobic with anaerobic treatment to optimize the conversion of OMW in biogas. Methods and Results: A 25-l air lift reactor was used to pretreat OMW by white-rot fungi. Detoxification of the OMW was monitored by size exclusion HPLC analysis, chemical oxygen demand (COD)/biological oxygen demand (BOD5) ratio evolution, and bioluminescence toxicity test. Anaerobic treatment of OMW was performed in a 12-l anaerobic filter reactor. Efficiency of the treatment was evaluated by organic matter removal, and biogas production. By comparison with the pretreatment by activated sludge only, the bioaugmentation with Phanerochaete chrysosporium or Trametes versicolor led to high removal of organic matter, decreased the COD/BOD5 ratio and the toxicity. The subsequent anaerobic digestion of the OMW pretreated with activated sludge-white-rot fungi showed higher biomethanization yields than that pretreated with activated sludge only. Higher loading rates (7 g COD l-1 day-1) were reached without any acidification or inhibition of biomethanization. Conclusions: The use of white-rot fungi, even in the presence of complex biological consortia to detoxify OMW, proved to be possible and made the anaerobic digestion of OMW for methane production feasible. Significance and Impact of the Study: The use of fungi for OMW reuse and energy production could be adapted to industrial applications. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Society for Applied Microbiology.},

abstract = {This review paper focuses on modelling of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). White-box modelling is widely applied in this field, with learning, design and process optimisation as the main applications. The introduction of the ASM model family by the IWA task group was of great importance, providing researchers and practitioners with a standardised set of basis models. This paper introduces the nowadays most frequently used white-box models for description of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal activated sludge processes. These models are mainly applicable to municipal wastewater systems, but can be adapted easily to specific situations such as the presence of industrial wastewater. Some of the main model assumptions are highlighted, and their implications for practical model application are discussed. A step-wise procedure leads from the model purpose definition to a calibrated WWTP model. Important steps in the procedure are: model purpose definition, model selection, data collection, data reconciliation, calibration of the model parameters and model unfalsification. The model purpose, defined at the beginning of the procedure, influences the model selection, the data collection and the model calibration. In the model calibration a process engineering approach, i.e. based on understanding of the process and the model structure, is needed. A calibrated WWTP model, the result of an iterative procedure, can usually be obtained by only modifying few model parameters, using the default parameter sets as a starting point. Black-box, stochastic grey-box and hybrid models are useful in WWTP applications for prediction of the influent load, for estimation of biomass activities and effluent quality parameters. These modelling methodologies thus complement the process knowledge included in white-box models with predictions based on data in areas where the white-box model assumptions are not valid or where white-box models do not provide accurate predictions. Artificial intelligence (AI) covers a large spectrum of methods, and many of them have been applied in applications related to WWTPs. AI methodologies and white-box models can interact in many ways; supervisory control systems for WWTPs are one evident application. Modular agent-based systems combining several AI and modelling methods provide a great potential. In these systems, AI methods on one hand can maximise the knowledge extracted from data and operator experience, and subsequently apply this knowledge to improve WWTP control. White-box models on the other hand allow evaluating scenarios based on the available process knowledge about the WWTP. A white-box model calibration tool, an AI based WWTP design tool and a knowledge representation tool in the WWTP domain are other potential applications where fruitful interactions between AI methods and white-box models could be developed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The use of white rot fungi (WRF) for bioremediation of recalcitrant trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) is becoming greatly popular. Biosorption and lignin modifying enzymes (LMEs) are the most often reported mechanisms of action. Intracellular enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP450), have also been suggested to contribute. However, direct evidence of TrOCs uptake and intracellular transformation is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative contribution of biosorption, extracellular LMEs activity, TrOCs uptake, and intracellular CYP450 on the removal of six nonsteroidal anti-inflamma-tories (NSAIs) by Trametes hirsuta. Results show that for most tested NSAIs, LMEs activity and biosorption failed to explain the observed removal. Most tested TrOCs are quickly taken up and intracellularly transformed. Fine characterization of intracellular transformation using ketoprofen showed that CYP450 is not the sole intracellular enzyme responsible for intracellular transformation. The contribution of CYP450 in further transformation of ketoprofen byproducts is also reported. These results illustrate that TrOCs transformation by WRF is a more complex process than previously reported. Rapid uptake of TrOCs and intracellular transformation through diverse enzymatic systems appears to be important components of WRF efficiency toward TrOCs.},

abstract = {Tamoxifen has been the most important therapeutic agent for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer for the past three decades. Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized by cytochrome F450 enzymes, and recent in vivo studies have shown that women with genetically impaired cytochrome P450 2D6 have reduced production of endoxifen and a higher risk of breast cancer recurrence. Despite these observations, the contribution of endoxifen to the overall drug effectiveness of tamoxifen remains uncertain. Here, we provide novel evidence that endoxifen is a potent antiestrogen that functions in part by targeting ERa for degradation by the proteasome in breast cancer cells. Additionally, we show that endoxifen blocks ERa transcriptional activity and inhibits estrogen-induced breast cancer cell proliferation even in the presence of tamoxifen, N-desmethyi-tamoxifen, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen. All of the effects of endoxifen are concentration dependent and do not occur at concentrations observed in human CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. These results support the theory that endoxifen is the primary metabolite responsible for the overall effectiveness of tamoxifen in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer, w{\~{a}}iua American Association tor cancer Kesearcn. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Association for Cancer Reasearch.},

abstract = {Cytotoxic drugs applied in chemotherapy enter the aquatic environment after patient's metabolism and excretion, in both main compounds and their respective metabolites. The increased consumption and discharge of these drugs raise concern on the genotoxic burden to non-target aquatic species, due to their unselective action on DNA. Settlement and adsorption of cytotoxic drugs to aquatic sediments pose risks to benthic species through chronic exposure. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects induced by the anticancer drug cyclophosphamide (CP) on the polychaete Nereis diversicolor, after 14 days of exposure to environmental relevant concentrations (10, 100, 500 and 1000 ng L−1). Burrowing impairment, neurotoxicity (Acetylcholinesterase - AChE activity), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase – SOD; catalase – CAT; glutathione peroxidases - GPXs activities), biotransformation (glutathione-S-transferases - GST), oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation - LPO) and genotoxicity (DNA damage) were assessed. Burrowing impairments were higher at the lowest CP concentrations tested. The higher CP levels tested (500 and 1000 ng L−1) induced a significant inhibition on the enzymatic antioxidant system (SOD, GPx) and on GST activity. DNA damage was also significant at these concentrations as an outcome of CP metabolism, and high levels of oxidative damage occurred. The results showed that the prodrug CP was metabolically activated in the benthic biological model N. diversicolor. In addition to the potential cytotoxic impact likely to be caused in aquatic species with similar metabolism, N. diversicolor proved to be reliable and vulnerable to the cytotoxic mode of action of CP, even at the lower doses.},

abstract = {Antineoplastic drugs are important in the treatment of cancer. Some interact directly with the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are of utmost importance in terms of risk. As highly active compounds, antineoplastics and their metabolites are largely excreted into wastewater and are found in the aquatic environment up to the lower $\mu$g/L range. Their predicted environmental concentrations are often below the action limit set in the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline. An in-depth risk assessment regarding their presence and effects in the aquatic environment is often not performed, and there is a lack of knowledge. This study considered whether there is an underestimation of possible risks associated with the presence of antineoplastic drugs with regard to trigger value stated in the EMA and FDA guidelines. In a balance, we identified a total of 102 active pharmaceutical ingredients of the ATC-group L01 (antineoplastic agents), which are environmentally relevant. In Germany, 20.7 t of antineoplastic agents was consumed in 2012. The share of drugs with DNA-damaging properties increased within the last 6 years from 24 up to 67 {\%}. Solely, capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil amount together 8 t—which corresponds to 39 {\%} of the total antineoplastic consumption. Around 80 {\%} of the total mass consumed could be attributed to prescriptions issued by office-based practitioners and is mostly excreted at home. Based on the different mode of actions, a case-by-case evaluation of the risk connected to their presence in the environment is recommended. DNA-damaging drugs should be assessed independently as no action limit can be assumed.},

WRF are capable of mineralizing a wide variety of toxic xenobiotics due to non-specific nature of their extracellular lignin mineralizing enzymes (LMEs). In recent years, a lot of work has been done on the development and optimization of bioremediation processes using WRF, with emphasis on the study of their enzyme systems involved in biodegradation of industrial pollutants. Many new strains have been identified and their LMEs isolated, purified and characterized.

abstract = {Diffuse sources of pollution such as sewer leakages, sewer overflows, illicit discharges and stormwater runoff affect the urban surface water quality but often remain unknown. Therefore, the development of chemical markers for identifying and characterizing the origin of diffuse sources of pollution in urban surface waters is a requisite for protecting and managing urban water resources. In this study, the occurrence of 31 emerging contaminants (ECs)in untreated wastewater, treated wastewater, urban stormwater runoff, agricultural stormwater runoff, and freshwater bodies was investigated. Artificial sweeteners (ASs), pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)were more frequently detected in the collected water samples. In raw wastewater, 21 target ECs were detected 100{\%} in the collected samples with median concentrations ranging from 49.6 to 77,721 ng/L, while in freshwater bodies, only 13 compounds were found with detection frequency {\textgreater}50{\%}. The median concentration of the majority of detected ECs in freshwater samples was below 100 ng/L. The suitability of ECs as chemical markers of diffuse sources in an urban watershed was assessed using a suite of criteria, including the detection frequency (DF), detection ratio (DR)(i.e. the ratio between median concentration and method quantification limit of a compound)and attenuation rates (i.e., biodegradation, sorption and abiotic degradation)in wastewater treatment processes. In addition, we propose a new key criterion, the concentration ratio (CR)of labile to conservative compounds, to evaluate the applicability of suitable chemical markers for source tracking. Using this new set of criteria (i.e. CR, DF, DR and attenuation rates), our analysis showed that among the investigated ECs, only acesulfame (ACE), acetaminophen (ACT), cyclamate (CYC), saccharin (SAC)were suitable as chemical markers of diffuse sources in surface waters. For caffeine (CF), N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), crotamiton (CTMT), triclocarban (TCC)and triclosan (TCS), their median concentration ratio to sucralose (SUC)in water bodies was consistently higher than that in raw wastewater, suggesting that these compounds might be unsuitable as chemical markers of sewage leakage in surface waters for this study area.},

Whole-cell WRF or their extracellular lignin modifying enzymes (LMEs) have been reported to efficiently degrade PPCPs that are persistent to conventional activated sludge process. WRF mediated treatment of PPCPs depends on a number of factors including physicochemical properties of PPCPs (e.g., hydrophobicity and chemical structure) and wastewater matrix (e.g., pH, temperature, and dissolved constituents), type of WRF species and their specific extracellular enzymes. This review critically analyzes the performance of whole-cell WRF and their LMEs for the removal of PPCPs; particularly, it offers insights into PPCP removal mechanisms (e.g., biosorption vs. biodegradation) and degradation pathways as well as the formation of intermediate byproducts.},

Data pertaining to 244 conventional activated sludge systems and 20 membrane biological reactors are analysed and the observed ranges of variability of each selected compound in their influent and effluent reported, with particular reference to the substances detected most frequently and in higher concentrations. A snapshot of the ability of these systems to remove such compounds is provided by comparing their global removal efficiencies for each substance. Where possible, the study then evaluates the average daily mass load of the majority of detected pharmaceuticals exiting the secondary treatment step. The final part of the review provides an assessment of the environmental risk posed by their presence in the secondary effluent by means of the risk quotient that is the ratio between the average pharmaceutical concentration measured in the secondary effluent and the predicted no-effect concentration. Finally, mass load rankings of the compounds under review are compared with those based on their risk level. This analysis shows that the highest amounts discharged through secondary effluent pertain to one antihypertensive, and several beta-blockers and analgesics/anti-inflammatories, while the highest risk is posed by antibiotics and several psychiatric drugs and analgesics/anti-inflammatories. These results are reported with a view to aiding scientists and administrators in planning measures aiming to reduce the impact of treated urban wastewater discharge into surface water bodies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The HA removal was assessed by color measurement and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis. T. versicolor showed the best decolorization efficiency of 90{\%} and yielded more than 45{\%} degradation of HA, which was the highest among the tested fungal strains. The nitrogen limitation was studied and results showed that it affected the fungal extracellular laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) activities. The results of the SEC analysis revealed that the mechanism of HA removal by WRF involves degradation of large HA molecules to smaller molecules, conversion of HA to fulvic acid-like molecules and also biosorption of HA by fungal mycelia. The effect of HS on the growth of WRF was investigated and results showed that the inhibition or stimulation of growth differs among the fungal strains.},

abstract = {This study considers the implications and research needs arising from anticancer (also referred to as antineoplastic) drugs being released into the aquatic environment, for the entire therapeutic classes used: cytotoxic, cytostatic and endocrine therapy drugs.A categorization approach, based on French consumption amounts, allowed to highlight parent molecules and several metabolites on which further occurrence and ecotoxicological studies should be conducted.Investigations of consumption trends at a national and a local scale show an increase in the use of anticancer drugs between 2004 and 2008, thus leading to increased levels released in the environment. It therefore appears necessary to continue surveying their presence in surface waters and in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents.Furthermore, due to the rise of anticancer home treatments, most of the prescribed molecules are now available in town pharmacies. Consequently, hospital effluents are no longer the main expected entry route of anticancer drugs into the aquatic environment.Concerning ecotoxicological risks, current knowledge remains insufficient to support a definitive conclusion. Risk posed by cytotoxic molecules is still not well documented and it is not possible to conclude on their long-term effects on non-target organisms. To date, ecotoxicological effects have been assessed using standardized or in vitro assays. Such tests however may not be suitable for anticancer drugs, and further work should focus on full-life cycle or even multigenerational tests.Environmental significance (i.e. occurrence and effects) of cytostatics (protein kinases inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies), if any, is not documented. Protein kinases inhibitors, in particular, deserve further investigation due to their universal mode of action.Finally, concerning endocrine therapy drugs, molecules such as antiestrogen Tamoxifen and its active metabolites, could be of concern.Overall, to accurately assess the ecotoxicological risk of anticancer drugs, we discuss the need to break away from tests on isolated molecules and to test effects of mixtures at the low ng.l-1 range. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This opinion paper assesses for the UK, whether the current use of cytotoxic drugs, one of the most toxic pharmaceuticals in common use, could pose a risk to aquatic organisms and to humans through water recycling. A water quality model was set up for one of these drugs, 5-fluorouracil, in the Aire and Calder catchment in Northern UK. The study predicts 5-50 ng/L concentrations for long stretches of this catchment under low flow conditions. Due to their mode of action, practically all eukaryotic organisms are vulnerable to damage, with teratogenicity being the greatest concern at such levels. However, it is unclear to what extent the predicted low concentrations would affect flora and fauna in receiving waters but there may be an additive effect of a mixture of cytotoxic drugs which should be taken into account. The exposure of the pregnant mother, or more specifically her foetus, to these drugs via drinking water should be minimised. Current drinking water purification technology gives grounds for optimism on removal of these compounds, but no appropriate data exist yet. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In Mediterranean regions where the population is rapidly growing, the risk of water resource contamination by wastewater is likely to increase. This is the case of the H{\'{e}}rault watershed (south of France), where the presence of treated wastewater in surface and ground waters has been shown in a previous study. To assess the consequence of these wastewater contaminations as regards pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds, 16 common pharmaceuticals (amitryptilin, acetylsalicylic acid, carbamazepine, clenbuterol, diazepam, diclofenac, doxepin, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, imipramine, ketoprofen, naproxen, nordiazepam, paracetamol, salbutamol, and terbutalin) as well as wastewater related pollutants (caffeine, gadolinium anomaly, and boron) were analyzed in wells pumped for potable water supply and in two wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. In addition, a monitoring along the Lergue River (the main tributary of the H{\'{e}}rault River) was achieved to assess pharmaceutical behavior in surface waters. Pharmaceuticals and other wastewater-related contaminants are present in several reservoirs tapped for drinking water, confirming wastewater contamination; paracetamol, caffeine, and diclofenac are the most frequently detected. Paracetamol is present at rather high concentrations (up to 11 $\mu$g/L and 211 ng/L, respectively, in a wastewater effluent and in a drinking water sample). Though degradable in WWTP, caffeine is commonly encountered in surface waters and detected in highly polluted groundwater. On the contrary, acetylsalicylic acid concentrations are generally low despite a large consumption in France; this is related to its metabolism in humans and rapid degradation in the aquatic environment. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Environmental monitoring is usually conducted by surface sampling to detect and quantify the presence of cytotoxic drugs after their reconstitution and administration. This technique reveals the origins of residual contamination and is an important component in order to protect healthcare workers from the potential risk of occupational exposure. The aim of this work is to compare various techniques and results of surface sampling for cytotoxics. For each technique, sample processing methods and their analysis were compared from literature data. Sampling is often performed by the wiping technique. After treatment, various single or multicompound technical analyses are used, in particular liquid or gas chromatography involving different detection methods: ultraviolet, mass spectrometry, plasma torch, and voltammetry. Some methods are validated to ensure reliability. Despite published guidelines and the use of isolator technology for the preparation of cytotoxic drugs, workplace contamination persists, leading to chemotherapeutic agents' exposure of healthcare workers. Efforts need to be maintained with particular emphasis on harmonization and on determining alert level for cytotoxic contamination.},
